## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a Senior Software Developer with 12 years of experience.
- Most of my career has been focused on developing services in Java, and I have recently started using it together with Kotlin.
- My additional specialization is DevOps. In this role, I gained broad experience, including setting up CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD), automating infrastructure provisioning (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation), automating deployments (Ansible), and implementing Helm charts to deploy applications to Kubernetes.
- For data analysis, I prefer Python, working with PySpark or Polars depending on the volume of data.
